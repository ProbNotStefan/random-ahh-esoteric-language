Works of pointer array like Brain Fuck.

`>` and `<` move left and right.

`+` and `-` decrement and increment current value at pointer adress.

`?n` and `?c` print current value at pointer adress as a number and a unicode characer respectively.
`??` prints the text that follows, ended by a | . You can use \n for a new line \\ for \ and \| for |. e.g. `??Hellow World!|`

`,uc` takes user input as a string and sets the current value and onwards as the unicode of each character.
`,un` or `,uf` takes user input as an integar of float respectively, specify `#`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `\` or `%` to do that operation to the current value at pointer adress (# = set). e.g. `,un*`
`,` + `c`, `#`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `\` or `%` takes the text that follows, ended by a | , and sets/runs an operation to the current value at pointer adress. e.g. `,#100|`

`[` and `]` start and end a loop, and repeats it the amount of times as the text that follows, ended by a | . e.g. `[32|+>]`

`@` followed by a number ended by a `|` , runs a different line of the code like a function, with a seperate pointer array. e.g. `@12|`

`Â¬` followed by a function name ended by a `|` and parameters seperated by a `|` and ended with `||` calls a function from one of the modules. e.g. `slp|10||`

For all commands that reqire a number to be entered, if you put `x` or `x` followed by number to increment the pointer, it will take the value at that pointer without changing the pointer. e.g. `,+x2|`

Current Modules:

Time:

`slp` + n: Sleeps for n seconds.

If:

`>` + a + b + code: Checks if a > b and if so, then it runs code. (int/float)

`<` + a + b + code: Checks if a < b and if so, then it runs code. (int/float)

`=` + a + b + code: Checks if a == b and if so, then it runs code. (string)

`!=` + a + b + code: Checks if a != b and if so, then it runs code. (string)

Random:

`rint` + min + max: Sets current value at pointer adress to random integer between min and max.

`rr`: Sets current value at pointer adress to random float between 0 and 1.

`runi` + min + max: Sets current value at pointer adress to random uniform between min and max.

Math:

`sqrt` + n: Sets current value at pointer adress to the square root of n.

`cbrt` + n: Sets current value at pointer adress to the cube root of n.

`fct` + n: Sets current value at pointer adress to the factorial of n.

`rad` + n: Converts the current value at pointer adress from degrees to radians.

`deg` + n: Converts the current value at pointer adress from radians to degrees.

`flr` + n: Sets current value at pointer adress to the floor of n.

`ceil` + n: Sets current value at pointer adress to the ceiling of n.

`round` + n + x: Sets current value at pointer adress to n rounded to x dp.

`sin` + n: Sets current value at pointer adress to sin(n). (takes radians)

`cos` + n: Sets current value at pointer adress to cos(n).

`tan` + n: Sets current value at pointer adress to tan(n).

`asin` + n: Sets current value at pointer adress to asin(n).

`acos` + n: Sets current value at pointer adress to acos(n).

`atan` + n: Sets current value at pointer adress to atan(n).

`sinh` + n: Sets current value at pointer adress to sinh(n).

`cosh` + n: Sets current value at pointer adress to cosh(n).

`tanh` + n: Sets current value at pointer adress to tanh(n).

`pi` Sets current value at pointer adress to PI.

All floats are rounded to 5 DP.
